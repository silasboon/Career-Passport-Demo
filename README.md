# VIU Career Passport Project Progress Report

## Introduction

The "VIU Career Passport" is a full-stack web application designed to empower students with access to knowledge and activity resources related to their field of study. The application aims to provide valuable insights into various job fields, assisting students in making informed career decisions. This progress report details the current state of the project, highlighting the technologies used, API endpoints implemented, and features completed thus far.

## Technologies Used

The "VIU Career Passport" application is built using the following technologies:

- Next.js: A popular React framework for server-side rendering and building modern web applications.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and scalability.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database management system used for data storage.
- Vercel: A platform for continuous deployment and hosting of web applications.

## API Endpoints

The application has been equipped with several API endpoints to facilitate data retrieval and management. The following endpoints have been implemented:

- `addKnowledgeCard`: This endpoint allows administrators to add a new knowledge card to the system, providing valuable information about specific job fields.
- `deleteKnowledgeCard`: Administrators can utilize this endpoint to remove knowledge cards that are no longer relevant.
- `getAllKnowledgeCards`: Students can access this endpoint to retrieve all available knowledge cards from the system.
- `getKnowledgeCards`: This endpoint enables students to fetch knowledge cards specific to their faculty or those available to all faculties.
- `getAllStudents`: Administrators can use this endpoint to retrieve information about all registered students in the system.
- `updateKnowledgeCard`: Administrators can update the information of a knowledge card using this endpoint.

## Knowledge Cards and Faculties

Knowledge cards form the core of the "VIU Career Passport" application. Each knowledge card contains valuable insights about a specific job field. The cards are organized based on faculties, making it easier for students to explore relevant career options within their areas of study.

For example, a knowledge card related to the "Computer Science" faculty will include details about career paths, job roles, and skill requirements within the computer science industry.

## Activities (Work in Progress)

The development of the activities feature is still ongoing. Once completed, the activities section will offer students opportunities to engage in career-related events, workshops, and networking sessions.

## Student Profile Page

The application includes a student profile page where registered students can update their personal information and change their passwords. Currently, the profile page's full functionality is still under development, and additional features are planned to enhance the user experience.

## Administrator Dashboard

The administrator dashboard serves as a control center for managing knowledge cards and, in the future, activities. Currently, administrators can update the information of existing knowledge cards using the dashboard.

## Future Enhancements

The "VIU Career Passport" project is continuously evolving, and future enhancements include:

- **Notifications and Messaging:** Implementing a notification system to keep students informed about upcoming activities and relevant updates.
- **Full Student Profile Functionality:** Enhancing the student profile page to enable complete profile management, including viewing past activities and career preferences.
- **Activities Management:** Completing the activities feature on the administrator dashboard, allowing administrators to create, update, and delete activity resources.

## Conclusion

The "VIU Career Passport" project has made significant strides in providing a platform for students to access valuable career-related knowledge. The application's foundation has been laid, with knowledge cards, faculty-specific categorization, and an administrator dashboard fully operational. As development continues, the addition of activities, notifications, and full student profile functionality promises to make the application an indispensable resource for VIU students as they explore their career paths.
